        Welcome to Academia!

Academia provides a great opportunity for students and professors to get to know each other. Students in high school aiming to get admitted into Universities can create a profile here and use this profile to apply to Universities of their choices.

Yes!! This reduces your efforts of applying the same profile information to many Universities. Helps you keep your profile organized in one place.

What is in it for Professors !! Well you can recommend and know a student's overall profile and make an informed decision about their admission to the university and whether you would want the student to assist you in your research!
