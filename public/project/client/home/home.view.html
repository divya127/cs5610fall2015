Academia provides a great opportunity for students and professors to get to know each other. Students in high school aiming to get admitted into Universities can create a profile here and use this profile to apply to Universities of their choices.
<p>
Yes!! This reduces your efforts of applying the same profile information to many Universities. Helps you keep your profile organized in one place.
</p>
        <p>
What is in it for Professors !! Well you can recommend and know a student's overall profile and make an informed decision about their admission to the university and whether you would want the student to assist you in your research!
